# Manifest authoring

Reference for authoring Dreamboard manifest.ts files.

`manifest.ts` defines the stable structure of your game: player counts, card
sets, zones, boards, pieces, dice, resources, and setup metadata.

Author manifests as a typed default export:

```ts
import { defineTopologyManifest } from "@dreamboard/sdk-types";

export default defineTopologyManifest({
  players: { minPlayers: 2, maxPlayers: 4, optimalPlayers: 4 },
  cardSets: [],
  zones: [],
  boards: [],
  pieceTypes: [],
  pieceSeeds: [],
  dieTypes: [],
  dieSeeds: [],
  resources: [],
  setupOptions: [],
  setupProfiles: [],
});
```

`defineTopologyManifest(...)` now matches the documented defaults here:
`boardTemplates` may be omitted entirely, and `sides` on die types is optional
with a default of `6`.

Boards describe positions, connections, and structural sites. Randomized setup
contents still belong in reducer setup code. In a Catan-style game, the
manifest should define stable hex spaces such as `cell-01`, `cell-02`, and
`cell-03`, while the reducer shuffles terrain pieces and number tokens onto
those spaces at runtime. In a square-grid game, the manifest should define
stable authored cells such as `a1`, `a2`, and `b1`, while reducer state tracks
movement, ownership, hazards, or score markers.

## Top-level shape

```json
{
  "players": { "...": "..." },
  "cardSets": [{ "...": "..." }],
  "zones": [{ "...": "..." }],
  "boardTemplates": [{ "...": "..." }],
  "boards": [{ "...": "..." }],

| Field | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `players` | Yes | Supported player counts |
| `cardSets` | Yes | Manual or preset card catalogs |
| `zones` | No | Shared and per-player containers; defaults to `[]` |
| `boardTemplates` | No | Reusable board topology; defaults to `[]` |
| `boards` | No | Shared and per-player board instances; defaults to `[]` |
| `pieceTypes` | No | Piece type definitions; defaults to `[]` |
| `pieceSeeds` | No | Seeded pieces; defaults to `[]` |
| `dieTypes` | No | Die type definitions; defaults to `[]` |
| `dieSeeds` | No | Seeded dice; defaults to `[]` |
| `resources` | No | Resource types; defaults to `[]` |
| `setupOptions` | No | Setup axes; defaults to `[]` |
| `setupProfiles` | No | Setup profiles; defaults to `[]` |

Top-level keys outside this schema are rejected when the manifest is loaded.

## Field schemas

Use schema-backed `fields` and `properties` surfaces to give authored data
structured typing. Write them on manual cards, board and template `fields`,
space `fields`, relation `fields`, container `fields`, edge `fields`, vertex
`fields`, and piece or die seed `fields`.

### Property entries

Each entry under `properties` describes a single field.

| Field | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | Yes | One of `string`, `integer`, `number`, `boolean`, `zoneId`, `cardId`, `playerId`, `boardId`, `edgeId`, `vertexId`, `spaceId`, `pieceId`, `dieId`, `resourceId`, `array`, `object`, `record`, `enum` |
| `description` | No | Short help text |
| `optional` | No | When `true`, the authored field may be omitted |
| `nullable` | No | When `true`, the authored field may be `null` |
| `items` | No | Required when `type` is `array` |
| `properties` | No | Required when `type` is `object` |
| `values` | No | Required when `type` is `record` |
| `enums` | No | Required when `type` is `enum` |

### Property maps

A `properties` map is an object of property names to property entries.
Properties are required unless the entry sets `optional: true`.

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "cost": { "type": "integer" },
    "terrain": {
      "type": "enum",
      "enums": ["forest", "hill", "field"]
    }
  }
}
```

`properties` and `fields` values in `manifest.ts` are stored as authored JSON
values. Keep those values consistent with the schema you declare.

When you author manifests in TypeScript with `defineTopologyManifest(...)`,
Dreamboard uses these schemas for static typing in authored source. That
currently covers manual card `properties`, `pieceSeeds[].fields`,
`dieSeeds[].fields`, and board or template `fields` surfaces. Keep these
schemas as plain authored objects; do not replace them with raw Zod values in
`manifest.ts`.

### Component `home`

Use `home` on cards, piece seeds, and die seeds to place authored inventory.

| `type` | Extra fields | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `detached` | None | Start unattached |
| `zone` | `zoneId` | Place into a zone |
| `space` | `boardId`, `spaceId` | Place onto a board space or hex space |
| `container` | `boardId`, `containerId` | Place into a board container |
| `edge` | `boardId`, `ref` | Place onto a tiled-board edge identified by one or two spaces |
| `vertex` | `boardId`, `ref` | Place onto a tiled-board vertex identified by one to four spaces |
| `slot` | `host.kind`, `host.id`, `slotId` | Place into a strict piece-owned or die-owned slot |

### Component `visibility`

| Field | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `faceUp` | No | Defaults to `true` |
| `visibleTo` | No | Player IDs that can see the component; omitted means visible to all players. In `manifest.ts`, `defineTopologyManifest(...)` narrows this to declared manifest player IDs. |

## `players`

| Field | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `minPlayers` | Yes | Integer from `1` to `10` |
| `maxPlayers` | Yes | Integer from `1` to `10` |
| `optimalPlayers` | No | Recommended player count |

## `cardSets`

`cardSets` define the cards that exist. They do not place cards into zones by themselves.

### Card set entry

| Variant | Required fields | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `type: "manual"` | `id`, `name`, `cardSchema`, `cards` | Define your own cards |
| `type: "preset"` | `id`, `presetId`, `name` | Use a built-in set with an explicit preset selector |

Current supported preset ID: `standard_52_deck`.

{/* Generated from examples/board-contract-lab/app/docs-snippets.ts (manifest-card-sets) */}

```ts
cardSets: [
  {
    type: "manual",
    id: "contract-cards",
    name: "Contract Cards",
  },
  {
    type: "preset",
    id: "poker-standard",
    presetId: "standard_52_deck",
    name: "Standard 52 Deck",
  },
],
//
```

### Manual card entry

Each entry in `cards[]` on a manual card set is a single authored card type.

| Field | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | Yes | Card type and single-copy runtime ID seed |
| `name` | Yes | Display name |
| `count` | Yes | Integer `>= 1` |
| `properties` | Yes | JSON-valued property map matching `cardSchema` |
| `imageUrl` | No | Image URL |
| `text` | No | Card text |
| `cardType` | No | Category or subtype |
| `home` | No | See [Component `home`](#component-home) |
| `visibility` | No | See [Component `visibility`](#component-visibility) |

```json
{
  "cardSets": [
    {
      "type": "manual",
      "id": "project-cards",
      "name": "Project cards",
      "cardSchema": {
        "properties": {
          "cost": { "type": "integer" },
          "tag": {
            "type": "enum",
            "enums": ["building", "science", "space"]
          }
        }
      },
      "cards": [
        {
          "type": "power-plant",
          "name": "Power Plant",
          "count": 1,
          "properties": {
            "cost": 11,
            "tag": "building"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## `zones`

Use `zones` for shared piles, per-player hands, pools, bags, and other table-level containers.

| Field | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | Yes | Pattern: `^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_-]*$` |
| `name` | Yes | Display name |
| `scope` | Yes | `shared` or `perPlayer` |
| `allowedCardSetIds` | No | Allowed card sets; enforced for card movement. In `manifest.ts`, `defineTopologyManifest(...)` narrows this to declared card-set IDs. |
| `visibility` | No | `ownerOnly`, `public`, or `hidden`; defaults to `public` |

```json
{
  "zones": [
    {
      "id": "project-deck",
      "name": "Project deck",
      "scope": "shared",
      "allowedCardSetIds": ["project-cards"],
      "visibility": "hidden"
    },
    {
      "id": "project-discard",
      "name": "Project discard",
      "scope": "shared",
      "allowedCardSetIds": ["project-cards"],
      "visibility": "public"
    },
    {
      "id": "project-hand",
      "name": "Project hand",
      "scope": "perPlayer",
      "allowedCardSetIds": ["project-cards"],
      "visibility": "ownerOnly"
    }
  ]
}
```

## `boardTemplates` and `boards`

Use templates when multiple boards share the same topology. Use boards for authored board instances that exist at runtime.

`layout` is the engine-level discriminator. `typeId` is the reducer-facing
category. For example, a Monopoly board would usually be `layout: "generic"`
with `typeId: "track"`.

One manifest can mix multiple board layouts. A shared generic economy board, a
shared hex map, and per-player square mats are a good authoring benchmark when
you want one workspace to cover the stricter board APIs in a realistic game
shape.

### Board template entry

| Variant | Required fields | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Generic | `id`, `name`, `layout: "generic"` | Optional `typeId` for authored board category |
| Hex | `id`, `name`, `layout: "hex"` | Optional `typeId`; `orientation` defaults to `pointy-top` |
| Square | `id`, `name`, `layout: "square"` | Optional `typeId`; uses authored `row` and `col` coordinates |

Generic templates can include `boardFieldsSchema`, `spaceFieldsSchema`,
`relationFieldsSchema`, `containerFieldsSchema`, and `spaces`, `relations`,
`containers`. Those arrays default to `[]`.

Hex templates can include `boardFieldsSchema`, `spaceFieldsSchema`,
`edgeFieldsSchema`, `vertexFieldsSchema`, and `spaces`, `edges`, `vertices`.
Those arrays default to `[]`.

Square templates can include `boardFieldsSchema`, `spaceFieldsSchema`,
`relationFieldsSchema`, `containerFieldsSchema`, `edgeFieldsSchema`,
`vertexFieldsSchema`, plus `spaces`, `relations`, `containers`, `edges`, and
`vertices`. Those arrays default to `[]`.

```json
{
  "boardTemplates": [
    {
      "id": "catan-island",
      "name": "Catan island",
      "layout": "hex",
      "orientation": "pointy-top",
      "spaces": [
        { "id": "cell-01", "q": 0, "r": 0, "typeId": "land" },
        { "id": "cell-02", "q": 1, "r": 0, "typeId": "land" },
        { "id": "cell-03", "q": 0, "r": 1, "typeId": "land" }
      ],
      "edges": [
        {
          "ref": { "spaces": ["cell-01", "cell-02"] },
          "typeId": "harbor"
        }
      ],
      "vertices": [
        {
          "ref": { "spaces": ["cell-01", "cell-02", "cell-03"] },
          "typeId": "settlement-site"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "boards": [
    {
      "id": "main-island",
      "name": "Main island",
      "layout": "hex",
      "scope": "shared",
      "templateId": "catan-island"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Board entry

| Field | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | Yes | Pattern: `^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_-]*$` |
| `name` | Yes | Display name |
| `layout` | Yes | `generic`, `hex`, or `square` |
| `typeId` | No | Authored board category used by reducer/UI code |
| `scope` | Yes | `shared` or `perPlayer` |
| `templateId` | No | Clone a template before applying inline additions |
| `fields` | No | JSON-valued board field map. In `manifest.ts`, this is schema-typed from `boardFieldsSchema ?? template.boardFieldsSchema`. |

Generic boards can add `boardFieldsSchema`, `spaceFieldsSchema`,
`relationFieldsSchema`, `containerFieldsSchema`, plus `spaces`, `relations`,
and `containers`. Those arrays default to `[]`.

Hex boards can add `orientation`, `boardFieldsSchema`, `spaceFieldsSchema`,
`edgeFieldsSchema`, `vertexFieldsSchema`, plus `spaces`, `edges`, and
`vertices`. Those arrays default to `[]`.

Square boards can add `boardFieldsSchema`, `spaceFieldsSchema`,
`relationFieldsSchema`, `containerFieldsSchema`, `edgeFieldsSchema`,
`vertexFieldsSchema`, plus `spaces`, `relations`, `containers`, `edges`, and
`vertices`. Those arrays default to `[]`.

### Generic space entry

Entries in `spaces[]` on generic boards or templates.

| Field | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | Yes | Board-local space ID |
| `name` | No | Display label |
| `typeId` | No | Authored space category used by reducer/UI code |
| `fields` | No | JSON-valued field map. In `manifest.ts`, this is schema-typed from `spaceFieldsSchema`. |

### Relation entry

Entries in `relations[]` on generic or square boards and templates.

| Field | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `typeId` | Yes | Relation category such as `adjacent` or `next` |
| `fromSpaceId` | Yes | Source space. In `manifest.ts`, `defineTopologyManifest(...)` narrows this to valid space IDs for the containing board or template-backed board. |
| `toSpaceId` | Yes | Target space. In `manifest.ts`, `defineTopologyManifest(...)` narrows this to valid space IDs for the containing board or template-backed board. |
| `id` | No | Stable relation ID |
| `directed` | No | Defaults to `false` |
| `fields` | No | JSON-valued field map. In `manifest.ts`, this is schema-typed from `relationFieldsSchema`. |

### Container entry

Entries in `containers[]` on generic or square boards and templates.

| Field | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | Yes | Board-local container ID |
| `name` | Yes | Display name |
| `host` | Yes | `{ "type": "board" }` or `{ "type": "space", "spaceId": "..." }`. In `manifest.ts`, space-hosted containers narrow `spaceId` to valid board-local spaces. |
| `allowedCardSetIds` | No | Allowed card sets. In `manifest.ts`, this narrows to declared card-set IDs. |
| `fields` | No | JSON-valued field map. In `manifest.ts`, this is schema-typed from `containerFieldsSchema`. |

Board containers are for attached holding areas such as market rows, discard
trays, or board-level displays. Board spaces are topology nodes in the board
graph such as squares, hexes, map locations, or action spots.

### Hex spaces, edges, and vertices

Entries in `spaces[]`, `edges[]`, and `vertices[]` on hex boards and templates.

| Field group | Required fields | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Space | `id`, `q`, `r` | Optional `typeId`, `label`, `fields`. In `manifest.ts`, `fields` is schema-typed from `spaceFieldsSchema`. |
| Edge | `ref` | `ref.spaces` must contain exactly 2 adjacent space IDs; optional `typeId`, `label`, `tags`, `fields`. In `manifest.ts`, `fields` is schema-typed from `edgeFieldsSchema`. |
| Vertex | `ref` | `ref.spaces` must contain exactly 3 touching space IDs; optional `typeId`, `label`, `tags`, `fields`. In `manifest.ts`, `fields` is schema-typed from `vertexFieldsSchema`. |

Use hex spaces for stable board positions. Use edges and vertices for
structural sites such as roads, borders, settlements, checkpoints, or other
game-specific metadata.

### Square spaces, edges, and vertices

Entries in `spaces[]`, `edges[]`, and `vertices[]` on square boards and
templates.

| Field group | Required fields | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Space | `id`, `row`, `col` | Optional `typeId`, `label`, `fields`. In `manifest.ts`, `fields` is schema-typed from `spaceFieldsSchema`. |
| Edge | `ref` | `ref.spaces` must resolve to exactly one shared border; optional `typeId`, `label`, `tags`, `fields`. In `manifest.ts`, `fields` is schema-typed from `edgeFieldsSchema`. |
| Vertex | `ref` | `ref.spaces` must resolve to exactly one shared corner; optional `typeId`, `label`, `tags`, `fields`. In `manifest.ts`, `fields` is schema-typed from `vertexFieldsSchema`. |

Use square spaces for stable board positions such as chess cells, tactical-map
tiles, or fixed tile-placement slots. Use square edges and vertices for shared
borders, gates, walls, crossings, scoring seams, or any other authored site
that sits between or around spaces.

Hex and square boards are fixed-topology in this release. Carcassonne-style
board growth is a future extension, not part of the current board layouts.

For a single real-game example that also lines up with piece and die seeds, a
Monopoly-style `track` board is the best fit.

```json
{
  "boards": [
    {
      "id": "main-board",
      "name": "Monopoly board",
      "layout": "generic",
      "typeId": "track",
      "scope": "shared",
      "spaces": [
        { "id": "go", "name": "GO", "typeId": "corner" },
        {
          "id": "mediterranean-avenue",
          "name": "Mediterranean Avenue",
          "typeId": "property"
        },
        {
          "id": "income-tax",
          "name": "Income Tax",
          "typeId": "tax"
        }
      ],
      "relations": [
        {
          "typeId": "next",
          "fromSpaceId": "go",
          "toSpaceId": "mediterranean-avenue",
          "directed": true
        },
        {
          "typeId": "next",
          "fromSpaceId": "mediterranean-avenue",
          "toSpaceId": "income-tax",
          "directed": true
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## `pieceTypes`, `pieceSeeds`, `dieTypes`, and `dieSeeds`

### Piece and die types

Entries in `pieceTypes[]` and `dieTypes[]`.

| Collection | Core fields | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pieceTypes[]` | `id`, `name` | Optional `fieldsSchema`; optional `slots` for strict piece-hosted slot definitions |
| `dieTypes[]` | `id`, `name` | Optional `sides` defaults to `6`; optional `fieldsSchema`; optional `slots` for strict die-hosted slot definitions |

### Piece and die seeds

Entries in `pieceSeeds[]` and `dieSeeds[]`.

| Field | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `typeId` | Yes | Piece type or die type ID |
| `id` | No | Runtime ID seed; falls back to `typeId` when omitted |
| `name` | No | Display label |
| `count` | No | Integer `>= 1`; defaults to `1` |
| `ownerId` | No | Player ID such as `player-1` |
| `home` | No | See [Component `home`](#component-home) |
| `visibility` | No | See [Component `visibility`](#component-visibility) |
| `fields` | No | JSON-valued field map |

Strict slot hosts must be singleton seeds with an explicit `id`. If a piece or
die type declares `slots`, every authored seed of that type must omit `count`
or set it to `1`, and must provide `id`.

### Complete strict-slot example

Use strict slots when one authored host piece or die owns named attachment
points and other components need stable homes on those hosts.

```ts
import { defineTopologyManifest } from "@dreamboard/sdk-types";

export default defineTopologyManifest({
  players: { minPlayers: 2, maxPlayers: 2 },
  boards: [],
  pieceTypes: [
    {
      id: "player-mat",
      name: "Player Mat",
      slots: [{ id: "worker-rest", name: "Worker Rest" }],
    },
    {
      id: "worker",
      name: "Worker",
    },
  ],
  pieceSeeds: [
    {
      id: "mat-alpha",
      typeId: "player-mat",
      ownerId: "player-1",
    },
    {
      id: "worker-a",
      typeId: "worker",
      ownerId: "player-1",
      home: {
        type: "slot",
        host: {
          kind: "piece",
          id: "mat-alpha",
        },
        slotId: "worker-rest",
      },
    },
  ],
  dieTypes: [
    {
      id: "die-holder",
      name: "Die Holder",
      slots: [{ id: "staging", name: "Staging" }],
    },
    {
      id: "d6",
      name: "D6",
      sides: 6,
    },
  ],
  dieSeeds: [
    {
      id: "holder-a",
      typeId: "die-holder",
    },
    {
      id: "die-a",
      typeId: "d6",
      home: {
        type: "slot",
        host: {
          kind: "die",
          id: "holder-a",
        },
        slotId: "staging",
      },
    },
  ],
  resources: [],
  setupOptions: [],
  setupProfiles: [],
});
```

That shape is the full authoring contract:

- declare slot IDs on `pieceTypes[].slots` or `dieTypes[].slots`
- seed each slot host as a singleton component with an explicit `id`
- place components into those homes with `home.type: "slot"` plus `host` and
  `slotId`

Reducer code can then inspect those placements through the injected `q.slot.*`
queries:

```ts
reduce({ state, accept, q }) {
  const slotOccupants = q.slot.pieceOccupantsByHost("mat-alpha");
  const workerAtRest = slotOccupants["worker-rest"]?.[0] ?? null;
  return accept(state);
}
```

Project those runtime `InSlot` locations into a reducer view before the UI
tries to render them:

```ts
import { defineView } from "@dreamboard/app-sdk/reducer";
import type { GameContract } from "./game-contract";

export const playerView = defineView<GameContract>()({
  project({ state, q }) {
    return {
      matOccupantsBySlotId: q.slot.pieceOccupantsByHost("mat-alpha"),
    };
  },
});
```

The UI can then render those same stable `(host.id, slotId)` pairs with
`SlotSystem`:

```tsx
import { useGameView, type SlotDefinition } from "@dreamboard/ui-sdk";
import { SlotSystem } from "./components/dreamboard";

const playerMatSlots: SlotDefinition[] = [
  {
    id: "mat-alpha:worker-rest",
    name: "Worker Rest",
    owner: "player-1",
    capacity: 1,
    group: "player-1",
  },
];

export function PlayerMatSlots() {
  const view = useGameView();
  const occupants = Object.values(view.matOccupantsBySlotId).flat();

  return (
    <SlotSystem
      slots={playerMatSlots}
      occupants={occupants}
      renderSlot={(slot, slotOccupants) => (
        <div>
          <strong>{slot.name}</strong>
          <div>{slotOccupants.map((entry) => entry.pieceId).join(", ") || "Empty"}</div>
        </div>
      )}
    />
  );
}
```

The same pattern works for die-hosted slots via `q.slot.dieOccupants(...)` and
`q.slot.dieOccupantsByHost(...)`. If you need one `SlotSystem` to render
multiple hosts at once, project composite slot IDs such as
`${hostId}:${slotId}` in the reducer view. For a single host, the query result
already matches `SlotSystem` directly.

`defineTopologyManifest(...)` from `@dreamboard/sdk-types` is the canonical
authoring API. It is a compile-time authoring layer only; it does not change
manifest JSON shape, backend contracts, or generated runtime behavior.

It currently adds these author-time checks in `manifest.ts`:

- schema-derived typing for manual card `properties`
- schema-derived typing for `pieceSeeds[].fields` and `dieSeeds[].fields`
- schema-derived typing for board, space, relation, container, edge, and vertex `fields`
- board-local narrowing for `fromSpaceId`, `toSpaceId`, and container host `spaceId`
- player-ID narrowing for `visibility.visibleTo`
- card-set ID narrowing for zone and board/container `allowedCardSetIds`
- board-scoped `spaceId`, `edgeId`, and `vertexId` property-schema literals inside board-backed field schemas
- existing narrowing for `space` and `container` homes from the selected `boardId`
- existing narrowing for `slot` homes from eligible singleton piece/die seeds whose type declares slots

Use plain authored objects for `properties`, `fieldsSchema`, and nested
`fields` schemas in `manifest.ts`. Do not replace them with raw Zod schemas.

## `resources`, `setupOptions`, and `setupProfiles`

### Resource entry

| Field | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | Yes | Pattern: `^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*$` |
| `name` | Yes | Display name |

```json
{
  "resources": [
    { "id": "megacredits", "name": "MegaCredits" },
    { "id": "steel", "name": "Steel" },
    { "id": "plants", "name": "Plants" }
  ]
}
```

### Setup option entry

| Field | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | Yes | Stable option ID |
| `name` | Yes | Display name |
| `description` | No | Help text |
| `choices` | No | Array of setup option choices; defaults to `[]` |

### Setup option choice

Entries in `choices[]` on a setup option.

| Field | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | Yes | Stable choice ID |
| `label` | Yes | Display label |
| `description` | No | Help text |

### Setup profile entry

| Field | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | Yes | Stable profile ID |
| `name` | Yes | Display name |
| `description` | No | Help text |
| `optionValues` | No | Map from setup option ID to selected choice ID |

`setupOptions` and `setupProfiles.optionValues` are metadata for UI and future
interactive setup composition. The runtime still selects setup by
`setupProfileId`, and actual setup execution stays in reducer-owned
`app/setup-profiles.ts`.

In practice, setup profiles are most useful when they point at real bootstrap
targets such as shared zones, per-player zones, shared board containers,
per-player board containers, and shared board spaces.

```ts
setupOptions: [
  {
    id: "map",
    name: "Map",
    choices: [
      { id: "frontier", label: "Frontier" },
      { id: "river", label: "River" },
    ],
  },
],
setupProfiles: [
  {
    id: "river-draft",
    name: "River Draft",
    optionValues: {
      map: "river",
    },
  },

## Derived behavior

- Player IDs are generated as `player-1` through `player-{maxPlayers}`.
- Optional top-level arrays default to `[]`.
- Zone `visibility` defaults to `public`.
- Relation `directed` defaults to `false`.
- Hex template and board `orientation` defaults to `pointy-top`.
- Component `visibility.faceUp` defaults to `true`.
- Piece and die seed `count` defaults to `1`.
- Die type `sides` defaults to `6`.
- Setup option `choices` defaults to `[]`.
- A manual card with `count > 1` expands to runtime card IDs like `{type}-1`,
  `{type}-2`, and so on. A single-copy card keeps `type` as its runtime ID.
- A piece or die seed with `count > 1` expands to runtime IDs like `{id}-1`,
  `{id}-2`, or `{typeId}-1`, `{typeId}-2` when `id` is omitted.
- A board with `scope: "perPlayer"` expands to runtime board IDs like
  `{boardId}:player-1`.
- Home references use authored board base IDs. Per-player boards resolve to the
  matching runtime board for the owning player.
- Slot homes use structured hosts like
  `{ "type": "slot", "host": { "kind": "piece", "id": "mat-a" }, "slotId": "worker-rest" }`.
- Only explicit singleton `pieceSeeds` and `dieSeeds` whose type declares
  `slots` can be referenced as slot hosts.
- For hex and square boards, authored `spaces` are the stable topology
  positions. Runtime `edgeId` and `vertexId` values are derived from those
  spaces. Authors attach metadata by referencing `ref.spaces`, not by writing
  edge or vertex IDs directly.
- In `manifest.ts`, board-scoped field schemas can still reference `spaceId`,
  `edgeId`, and `vertexId` values directly. `defineTopologyManifest(...)`
  narrows those to the exact derived ID literals for the containing board or
  template-backed board.
- Preset card sets are materialized into authored cards before code generation.
  Use `presetId` to select the built-in deck while keeping `id` as the local
  card-set ID that flows into generated unions and `allowedCardSetIds`.
- `setupProfiles.optionValues` must reference declared setup options and
  declared choice IDs.
- Dreamboard generates literal unions and Zod schemas for authored categories
  such as `BoardLayout`, `BoardTypeId`, `SpaceTypeId`, `RelationTypeId`,
  `EdgeTypeId`, and `VertexTypeId`.
- Dreamboard generates typed runtime ID literals, authored category unions, Zod
  schemas, and lookup helpers from the manifest for players, cards, zones,
  boards, resources, setup options, setup profiles, and schema-backed fields.

If you are deciding between one shared zone and one copy per player, use this
rule: `scope: "shared"` means exactly one table-wide container, and
`scope: "perPlayer"` means Dreamboard materializes one container per player.
